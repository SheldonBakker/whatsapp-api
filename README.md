# WhatsApp REST API

A powerful REST API wrapper for the [whatsapp-web.js](https://github.com/pedroslopez/whatsapp-web.js) library, providing an easy-to-use interface to interact with the WhatsApp Web platform. This project is designed to be used as a Docker container, making it scalable, secure, and easy to integrate with other non-NodeJS projects.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

**NOTE**: This project is not affiliated with WhatsApp or Meta. I can't guarantee you will not be blocked by using this method, although it has worked for me. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.

## üìñ Usage

### Creating a Session

To use this API, you first need to create a WhatsApp session:

1. Make a GET request to `/session/start/{sessionId}` where `sessionId` is a unique identifier for your session
2. Get the QR code by requesting `/session/qr/{sessionId}/image`
3. Scan the QR code with your WhatsApp mobile app
4. Check session status with `/session/status/{sessionId}`

### Sending a Message

Once your session is connected, you can send a message:

```http
POST /client/sendMessage/{sessionId}
Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: your-api-key

{
  "chatId": "123456789@c.us",
  "contentType": "string",
  "content": "Hello from WhatsApp API!"
}
```

### API Documentation

When the server is running, you can access the full Swagger documentation at:
http://localhost:3000/api-docs

## üìä Available Endpoints

The API provides endpoints for various WhatsApp functionalities:

### Session Management
- Create, check status, and terminate sessions
- Get QR code for authentication

### Messaging
- Send text messages
- Send media (images, documents, audio)
- Send location, buttons, lists, contacts, polls
- Delete messages

### Chats

Content-Type: application/json
x-api-key: your-api-key

{
  "chatId": "123456789@c.us",
  "contentType": "MessageMedia",
  "content": {
    "mimetype": "image/jpeg",
    "data": "base64-encoded-data",
    "filename": "image.jpg"
  }
}
```

## Advanced Features

- Customizable per-session configurations
- Session persistence between server restarts
- Docker-optimized deployment with volume mounts
- Support for both headless and non-headless browser modes

## Setting up Multiple Sessions

Each session can be customized with its own user agent and webhook URL:

### Configure via Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```
# Custom user agent for a session named "session1"
SESSION1_USER_AGENT=Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 14_7_1 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/14.1.2 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1

# Custom webhook for a session
SESSION1_WEBHOOK_URL=http://localhost:8080/session1-webhook
```

### Create a New Session

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1/start" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Get QR Code for Authentication

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1/qr" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Or visit `http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1/qr-scan` in your browser to scan the QR code.

### Check Session Status

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1/status" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### List All Sessions

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/api/sessions" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Terminate a Session

```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Session Persistence

Sessions are automatically restored when the server restarts. Each session maintains its own data and authentication state independently.

## Troubleshooting

### Session Persistence Issues

If you encounter issues with sessions not persisting between restarts:

1. Ensure the required directories exist and are writable:
   - `.cache/puppeteer`
   - `.wwebjs_auth`
   - `sessions`

   When using Docker, these directories are automatically created and mounted as volumes.

2. Verify that the environment variables are set correctly
3. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   # For local development
   npm start

   # For Docker
   docker-compose restart
   ```

### Stuck Sessions

If a session gets stuck, you can restart it:

```bash
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:3000/api/session/session1/restart" -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Docker-Specific Issues

For Docker-specific troubleshooting, refer to the [Docker README](README.docker.md).
